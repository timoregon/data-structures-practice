# Just a bunch of practice stuff for the Data Structures course

## Getting Started
Luckily, I've already got gcc on my macbook. So you can write code as seen in 
main.c. To create that all I did was make a text file named main.c and wrote 
that code in it. Then when you want to compile it write

$ gcc -Wall -o <name_of_output> main.c

That will make an executable file called <name_of_output>. To execute it just
write 

$ ./<name_of_output>
